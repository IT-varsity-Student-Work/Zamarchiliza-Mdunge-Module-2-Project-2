        <h3>MY SPY</h3>
        
        <p>JJ's a hardened CIA directive who's been demoted and finds himself at the mercy of a precocious 9-year-old girl named Sophie when he's sent undercover-begrudgingly-to surveil her family. When Sophie discovers hidden cameras in their apartment, she uses her tech savvy to crack his surveillance operation. In exchange for not blowing his cover, Sophie convinces him to spend time with her, and teach her to be a spy. Despite his reluctance, JJ finds that he's no match for Sophie's disarming charm and wit.</p>
